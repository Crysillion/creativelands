"Creative Lands" pack for Terra
(because I don't really have a good name for it lol)

This pack was originally intended for personal use only, but I have since stopped working on Minecraft servers and decided to publish it for public use.

That said, this pack includes large schematics. These will slow world generation considerably and in the case of lesser hardware, crash the generation process completely.

Not everything in this pack is perfect. I'm far from a perfectionist and some things kind of just "are" and I left them there strictly because I didn't want to deal with fixing them, plus they were small enough flaws that players were able to look past them when playing, so it didn't much matter in the end anyway.

I offer little-to-no support for this pack. Feel free to look through it, see some of the biomes I've made, use it as you see fit, get inspiration for your own biomes, or whatever.

I hope I'm not coming off as rude when saying I offer no support, but I'm done with Minecraft for now and have no desire to mess with it in any capacity.

Good luck and have fun!
